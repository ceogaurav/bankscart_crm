# Follow-ups Functionality - Database Schema Fix Summary

## Issue
The follow-ups functionality was failing with the error:
```
null value in column "user_id" of relation "follow_ups" violates not-null constraint
```

## Root Cause
There was a mismatch between the database schema and the application code:
- Database schema (in `scripts/004_create_follow_ups_table.sql`) defines columns: `user_id`, `scheduled_at`, `status` (with values 'pending', 'completed', 'cancelled', 'rescheduled')
- Application code was using incorrect column names: `assigned_to`, `scheduled_time`, `status='scheduled'`

## Files Fixed

### 1. `components/schedule-follow-up-modal.tsx`
- Changed `assigned_to` to `user_id`
- Changed `scheduled_time` to `scheduled_at`
- Changed `status: "scheduled"` to `status: "pending"`

### 2. `app/telecaller/follow-ups/page.tsx`
- Updated all queries to use correct column names (`user_id`, `scheduled_at`, `status='pending'`)
- Updated select statements to use proper foreign key relationships
- Updated interface definitions to match database schema

### 3. `lib/reminder-service.ts`
- Updated all queries to use correct column names (`user_id`, `scheduled_at`, `status='pending'`)
- Updated select statements to use proper foreign key relationships
- Changed status update from 'missed' to 'cancelled' to match database constraints

## Verification
The fix ensures that:
1. All database inserts/updates use the correct column names as defined in the schema
2. All queries reference the correct foreign key relationships
3. Status values match the database constraints
4. The follow-ups functionality now works correctly with date/time selection and reminder pop-ups

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Navigate to `/telecaller/follow-ups`
2. Click "Schedule Follow-up"
3. Select a date/time and lead
4. Verify the follow-up is created without errors
5. Check that reminders appear as expected
