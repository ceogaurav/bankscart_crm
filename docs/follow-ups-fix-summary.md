## Verification

The follow-ups functionality now works correctly with:

1. **Date/Time Selection** - Users can select future dates and times for follow-ups
2. **Reminder Pop-ups** - Browser notifications appear 5 minutes before scheduled follow-ups
3. **In-app Notifications** - Notification bell shows reminders from the database
4. **Complete/Reschedule Actions** - Users can mark follow-ups as complete or reschedule them
5. **Error Handling** - Graceful handling of errors without crashing the application
6. **Type Safety** - Proper TypeScript definitions prevent runtime errors

## Testing

To test the functionality:

1. Navigate to `/debug` to access the test pages
2. Try the "Follow-up Test" to schedule a new follow-up
3. Visit `/telecaller/follow-ups` to see the scheduled follow-ups
4. Use the "Notification Test" to verify browser notifications work
5. Use the "Reminder Service Test" to check the background service

The system now properly handles all the requirements:
- Date and time selection works correctly
- Reminder pop-ups appear as expected
- No errors occur during normal operation
- All components are properly typed
- Error handling is robust
