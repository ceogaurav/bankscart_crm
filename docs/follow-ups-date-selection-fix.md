# Follow-ups Date Selection - Fix Summary

## Issue
The date selection functionality in the follow-ups scheduling modal was not working correctly.

## Root Cause
The issue was with how the date and time values were being combined and processed:
1. Inconsistent date/time combination logic
2. Lack of proper debugging information
3. Insufficient error handling

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Improved Date/Time Combination Logic
- Properly set hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds when combining date and time
- Used `setHours(hours, minutes, 0, 0)` to ensure clean time values

### 2. Enhanced Default Date Initialization
- Set consistent default values for future dates (tomorrow at 9:00 AM)
- Added proper time initialization with `setHours(9, 0, 0, 0)`

### 3. Added Comprehensive Debugging
- Added console logging for:
  - Modal opening and default values
  - Date selection events
  - Time input changes
  - Combined datetime values
  - ISO datetime strings
- Enhanced error messages with actual Supabase error details

### 4. Improved Validation
- More explicit datetime validation
- Better past date checking with clear error messages

## Verification
The date selection now works correctly:
1. Calendar date selection functions properly
2. Time input updates correctly
3. Date/time combination produces valid datetime values
4. Future date validation works as expected
5. Debug information helps identify any issues

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Navigate to `/telecaller/follow-ups`
2. Click "Schedule Follow-up"
3. Select a date from the calendar
4. Change the time value
5. Verify the combined datetime is correct in browser console
6. Submit the form and check for successful creation
